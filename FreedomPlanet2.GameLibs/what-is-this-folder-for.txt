From the BepInEx plugin starter guide: 

"IMPORTANT
If possible, do not reference the assemblies directly from the game folder!
Doing so might cause referencing issues in some versions of C# compilers.
Instead, create a lib folder inside your plugin project and copy any game assemblies to there that you want to reference."

In my copy of the project, I copied my FP2 Assembly-CSharp.dll here from "E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Freedom Planet 2\FP2_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll" . You'll want to copy it from where your own FP2 game install is. And you may want to update the copy when the game version updates as well.

You don't HAVE to do this, you CAN reference the version of the file directly from the FP2 install folder. But BepInEx docs says not so, so I didn't.
